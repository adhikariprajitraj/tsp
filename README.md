# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in Nepal

## Overview
This project solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using major cities in Nepal as nodes. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the original city.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains JSON files with cities and their coordinates.
- `src/`: Contains the Python scripts for solving the TSP and generating the map visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project documentation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Gurobi Optimizer (for solving the TSP)
- Folium (for map visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive execution)
